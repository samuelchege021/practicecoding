It is an email address that ends in @yourbusiness or @yourdomainname, plus your top level domain (e.g. .com or .site), whereas a free, generic email will have a generic domain. Since your business email is aligned to your business name, it allows clients and customers to recognize you, and helps to gain trust and legitimacy."},{"question":"Is Titan an email hosting service?","answer":"Yes. Email hosting is a service that enables you to set up a custom email address, send and receive emails, and store related files on a server. While setting up hosted email services, your website from your current web host will still be able to operate at full scale."},{"question":"Is Titan included in the LOGO Pro subscription?","answer":"No, Titan isn’t included in the LOGO Pro subscription and will require a separate purchase."},{"question":"Do I need to have a website or create a business email address with Titan?","answer":"You don’t need an active website to use Titan, but you do need your own domain name. By using your domain for both a website and an email address, you create a more trusted business presence. Click on ‘Domains’ in the left-hand menu of your dashboard to register your domain name."},{"question":"Can I migrate my existing account to Titan?","answer":"Yes. Titan comes with built-in migration tools to help you easily move existing email data to your Titan account.
