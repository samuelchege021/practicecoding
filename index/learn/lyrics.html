Talking away, … I don’t know what I’m to say.
I’ll say it anyway, … today’s another day to find you.
Shine away, … I’ll be coming for your love, OK.

Take on me, (take on me).
Take me on, (take on me).
I’ll be gone … in a day or two.
So, needless to say, at odds and ends, but I feel,
Stumbling awake, slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me: … it’s so much better to be safe than sorry.
Take on me, (take on me).

Take me on, (take on me).
I’ll be gone … in a day or two.
Oh, things that you say, yeah is it life or just to play
My worries away, you’re all the things I’ve got to remember.
You shine away … I’ll be coming for you anyway.
Take on me, (take on me).

Take me on, (take on me).
I’ll be gone … in a day or two.
Take on me, (take on me).
Take me on, (take on me).
I’ll be gone … in a day or two.
