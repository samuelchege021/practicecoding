#user defined structure.#workin the basis of the last in first out(lifo)principle



#elemnts can be pushed accessed ppopped as required
#elemnts are accessed from from the top





#queue
#work in the basis of the fisrt in first out(fifo)principle
#queus have both head and tails
#operatins cans be done on both head and tails.



#trees and nodes

#trees have roots and noodes
#     the data originate from tghe root node of the tree,
#every node trhat precede another node is called parent node
#last node is called the leaves.




#Graph
#A grapoh has a collection of nodes and edges

#nodes are also called vertices and edges are called as arcs
#a valis graph structure consists of finite set iof nodes and edges
#everyone in the facebook is the vertesex in the network.




#Bonus data structure
     #linked lists
     
    #it consists of a sequence of elemnts that are connected to each other
    #each data elemnt is scionnctes to another one via pointer
    #python does not have linked list in its standard libtrary
     #implementation to be done wjhen using lists manually.
     #5->10->20, pointer is used
